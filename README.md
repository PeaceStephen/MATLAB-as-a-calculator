QUESTION:
Let's calculate the number of kilometers in a light year, which is the distaance that a light beam will travel in a year.

FORMULA:
The formula to get the number of Kilometers in a light year:
lightyear_km = year_sec*speed_kps

FORMULAS EXPLAINED:
lightyear_km = number of Kilometers in a light year
year_sec = number of seconds in a year
speed_kps = speed of light in kilometers per seconds

SPEED OF LIGHT CONVERSION:
Speed of light in mps = 3*10^8,
In this situation where our question was given in kps, we will convert the mps to kps
300000000/1000 = 300000kps
Key words: 
mps = meter per seconds
kps = kilometer per seconds

YEAR SEC  CALCULATION:
year_sec is defined as the number of seconds in a year
To get the year_sec in a year, we have:
365 days in a year
24 hours in a day 
60 minutes per hour
60 seconds per minutes
yeaar_sec: 365*24*60*60 = 31536000

So we have our:
speed_kps = 300000
year_sec = 31536000
lightyear_km = ?

FINAL ANSWER:
lightyear_km = speed_kps*year_sec
300000*31536000= 9.4608e+12

EXPLANING THE ANSWER:
With a normal calculator, I got my answer to be 9.4608*10^5 which is the same thing as 9.4608e+12 
MATLAB wrote the answer in scientific notation:
e = means the power of 10 
12 = means the number of times the e(10) will raised to
In normal terms, the answer will be :
9.4608*10^12 = 9.4608*1000000000000
